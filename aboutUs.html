        <p class="para"><span style="padding-left: 50px;">Shikshan Sanstha</span>  has been an outstanding charitable institution & is very popular. The increasing demands of society & self employment opportunities, besides many other factors were responsible to force the founder of Shriram Shikshan Sanstha to start a humble beginning in the area of education in Engineering & Technology. The efforts were recognized last year in 2008-09 by granting permission to Shriram Shikshan Sanstha to conduct different three years Degree Courses.

            Shriram Shikshan Sanstha has many courses like D.Ed, B.Ed, Shriram Madhyamik Vidyalaya, English Medium School, D.Pharmacy, D.Pharmacy, I.T.C. , diploma engineering college(Polytechnic) , Degree Engineering College, Agricultural degree course .</p>
            
           <p  class="para"> In year 2008-09 Sanstha management decided to start courses Bsc(E.C.S.) and BCA. College is located in rural area and there were no any institution which provides these courses. Management body realized the importance of IT education. There is huge scope for IT developer and IT technicians in IT industries. But no any college provides these courses. For rural area students this is big opportunity to learn this type of courses. Students from rural area not so familiar to computer and IT field.
            
            So after starting these course we are very glad to inform there is large response of students for these courses.</p>
